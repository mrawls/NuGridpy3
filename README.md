# NuGridpy3
This is a version of NuGridpy that works with Python 3.

Original source: http://nugridpy.phys.uvic.ca

I used 2to3 and then manually adjusted indentations and such until I could run `python setup.py install` with no errors under the new AstroConda Python 3.5. No promises, but it seems to work for me.
